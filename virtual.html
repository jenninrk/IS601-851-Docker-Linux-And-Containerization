        <h1>What Is Virtualization?</h1>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtualization has been defined as the art and science of making the function of an object or resource, typically a computing resource, as simulated by software identical in function to that of its corresponding physically realized version (Network World).</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of virtualization, also known as virtual machines, , actually originated in the architecture of some of the world’s first mainframe computers, like the IBM 360, during the 1960’s.  Later, this concept of virtualization was carried forward in the design of the next generation personal computers, which were foundational to the advent of the distributed processing model in the decades following.  Virtual machines have been instrumental in the management of scarce computing resources ever since.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary early examples of this concept were in the areas of timeshare applications, and also Remote Terminal.  Size and availability of computing resources precluded their ubiquity, resources but through the deployment of Remote Terminals connected to their mainframes through the telephony network, computing power could be made available to potential users regardless of time or geography.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mainframe services were not the only computing resources that could be emulated – desktop functionality, memory, network and storage all could be virtualized on a large scale, in an effort to get resources into users hands in a more cost effective and efficient way.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, user needs have evolved even further.  And through virtualization, benefits are still being realized, albeit on a smaller scale. With changes in and to proprietary software, as well as the ongoing need to manage and minimize major hardware assets, virtualization is more important now than ever in the fully networked world.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implemented by sitting a hypervisor and guest operating systems atop a host operating system, virtualization can allow even a single user to run multiple applications simultaneously.  Perhaps because of applications requiring a specific type of operating system for support, or perhaps due to a need to run concurrently both test and production software while in development, or perhaps just to drive a more efficient use of resources, thereby maintaining a lower cost of ownership, virtualization continues to address needs in the computing community.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtualization is not without its flaws. There are some drawbacks that need to be considered prior to implementation. Most generally related to performance, stability and throughput, these limitations do not lend themselves well to certain types of installations. As processors begin to handle a larger workload and more concurrent sessions, , overhead in data packets increases to support addressing needs associated with interleaving tasks.  This adds to load, which can compromise CPU stability of overtaxed. Ultimately, throughput and perceived performance can degrade based on “busyness”.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, as with all things, virtualization can improve efficiencies and costs associated with hardware computing resources, although this can be somewhat offset by increased software costs necessitated to handle additional applications load. Furthermore, when architecting, it is essential not to over-engineer resources, as diminishing returns can occur if too many applications are deployed on resources inadequate to scale without noticeable performance degradation.</p>
        <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, correctly and thoughtfully implemented, virtualization can bring many important benefits to users everywhere.</p>
